# one-per-record

A couple of years back I was gifted a whole bunch of records by some family members. Having finally got myself set up to play records again this year I've begun the process of listening to every record gifted. I'm choosing one track from every record to add to this playlist. This is still very much a work in progress with more than half the records still to go. Once I'm finished I'll work out how to put them into a more interesting and congruent order.
