# Gear

This post catalogues the history of my photography gear. My first memory of being interested in photography, was when I found myself jealous of a digtal Canon compact camera that my sister got for her birthday. It took AA batteries and drained them in a matter of minutes. My own first camera was a <Camera name="Fuji FinePix F30" />. My first "serious" camera, which at the time I thought of as a synonym for a DSLR, was a <Camera name="Pentax K-m" />. Wanting cheap led me to old manual focus Pentax K-mount lenses, and those in turn led me to the <Camera name="Pentax MX" /> 35mm film SLR. Everything else follows from there.

### My First Camera

My first camera was a <Camera name="Fuji FinePix F30" />.

I'd done lots of online research, reading reviews. I learned the basics of ISO, aperture and shutter speed from the reading I did at that time.

The camera took nice pictures for what it was, but technology has come a long way - the pictures don't compete with a phone from 10 years later.

### The Pentax Era

I wanted to get a "proper camera". At the time this meant a DSLR. From the very beginning I was interested in the idea of a camera being small, something that would stick with me, bar a few mistakes here and there. The <Camera name="Pentax K-m" /> was one of the smallest DSLRs available at the time, and I remember in-body image stablization being the other big selling point. I'm not sure I've had a camera with any type of image stablization since.

I had a couple of not-great kit lenses that came as part of the set.

- [Photos tagged with <Lens name="smc Pentax-DA 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 AL" />](/photos/tag?tag=smc%20Pentax-DA%2018-55mm%20f3.5-5.6%20AL)

I gained some understanding, somewhere along the line, that prime lenses would be sharper than zoom lenses. I know this is less true with modern lenses today, but at the time this was as true as anything. I didn't have much money to spend, but there were tons of quick prime lenses for Pentax K mount on eBay for < £30. I bought a <Lens name="smc Pentax-M 50mm f1.7" /> for somewhere around that figure, and I took 95% of my photos from then on using that lens. I wasn't bothered by the lack of auto-focus, despite me missing focus quite a lot. With the crop factor, it was the equivilant of 75mm, which I'd now find akward for an everyday lens. But the pictures were sharper, and taking pictures was infinitely more fun.

![](flickr://4316875728 "Having a fast prime brought on a lot of gig photography. Pentax K-m / Pentax 50mm f1.7")

I bought some other lenses. They got used, but not exactly a lot in comparison to the nifty-fifty.

Just before the end of the year, I bought a film SLR for K mount, the <Camera name="Pentax MX" />. This is the camera that took my interest in photography another level. Playing around with film in 2009 had become a pretty niche interest. I shot my first roll of film visiting a friend studying a year abroad in Gratz alongside another friend.

### Pentax Continued

After hearing about my ventures into film, my Uncle passed his old film SLR onto me, which just so happened to be another Pentax, a <Camera name="Pentax K1000" /> with a <Lens name="smc Pentax-M 50mm f2" />. I barely touched the lens given I had the f1.7 version, and I'm pretty sure I ended up giving it to my sister at some point.

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Pentax K1000" />](/photos/tag?tag=Pentax%20K1000)

I didn't stop at 2 film SLRs. I added a <Camera name="Pentax ME Super" /> to the collection as it had aperture priority, which appealed to me over the fully manual process of shooting with the MX or K1000.

My philosophy on automation in photography is that I want control over everything required to take the picture I want to take, and to be able to ignore everything else. Most of the time, that means to me that aperture priority, with some method for exposure compensation, trumps fully manual. When shutter speed is important for my photo, I'm still generally happy to give the camera control of ISO to get me the exposure I want.

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Pentax ME Super" />](/photos/tag?tag=Pentax%20ME%20Super)

I added a couple more lenses as well. First ultra-wide <Lens name="Cosina 20mm f3.8 MC" />, which I appear to have barely touched. By most accounts I've found, it's not a great lens. Second, and more interestingly, the <Lens name="smc Pentax-M 40mm f2.8" /> which is a tiny pancake lens.

### Week of Dark

In March 2010 I learned how to use a darkroom for the first time with a group of like-minded, but similarly inexperienced, friends at the University of Bristol darkroom. Later on I would be the darkroom manager at these darkrooms.

![](flickr://4479786917 "Self portrait from one of my first self-developed films.")

### Canon Digital

While I continued on the Pentax front for film cameras, I'd fallen out with the <Camera name="Pentax K-m" />. In many respects it just wasn't very good, and I didn't have the right lenses given the crop factor! I remember bidding on this big batch load of Canon lenses alongside a <Camera name="Canon 40D" /> on ebay in the middle of a Computer Science lab at University of Bristol. My student maintainace loan had come through, and I blew most of it on this knowing I could sell most of the lenses and make a profit even when keeping the 40D.

According to the EXIF data on the photos, I'd bought the camera off a guy called "Robert Olejnik" — apparently I never did a factory reset.

I sold all the lenses that came with the body with the exception of a <Lens name="Canon EF 50mm f1.8 II" />. Shortly afterwards I added a <Lens name="Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC HSM" />. I have really fond memories of the Sigma; 30mm is finally a sensible normal focal length on a body with a 1.5 crop factor.

### Continuing to explore film cameras

I'm on eBay daily by this point. Over the remainder of the year I bought a number of other film cameras that I proceeded to barely use. My "one-roll-wonders" so to speak.

The <Camera name="Olympus Trip 35" /> put me off zone-focusing. Mostly, it just didn't do anything that my other film cameras didn't already do better for me.

![](flickr://5086247353 "The Olympus Trip 35 was a pretty fun camera to take on a walk through the Mendips.")

The <Camera name="Olympus 35 ECR" /> put me off rangefinders. I struggled a bit with the focusing, not that I would miss the focus, but it took me too long with the small and indistinct rangefinder patch.

- [Photos tagged with <Camera name="Olympus 35 ECR" />](/photos/tag?tag=Olympus%2035%20ECR)

I also bought an <Camera name="Action Sampler" /> (or so it was called), which was a mildly distracting toy. It takes four photos on each frame, each one a short amount of time after the other. I never took a compelling photo that actually used the feature, instead I just got four poor quality pictures on each frame.

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Action Sampler" />](/photos/tag?tag=Action%20Sampler)

I also shot a single roll on a <Camera name="Kodak Pop" />. I think this camera maybe cost me a £2.

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Kodak Pop" />](/photos/tag?tag=Kodak%20Pop)

I had a brief excursion into Canon film cameras with the <Camera name="Canon EOS 300" />. Wierdly, the only photos I have lying around from it were ones taken with the <Lens name="Sigma 30mm f1.4 EX DC HSM" />, which is only designed to cover the Canon digital crop sensors.

### Instax

I also started playing around with instant photography for the first time with the <Camera name="Fuji Instax Wide" />. My instax however developed a light leak after a while and then the motor that moved the lens jammed up. Gone before its time.

![](flickr://5283974244 "Light leak on my Fuji Instax Wide.")

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Fuji Instax Wide" />](/photos/tag?tag=Fuji%20Instax%20Wide)

### First Medium Format

My first dip into medium format was a borrowed <Camera name="Yashicamat 124G" />.

![](flickr://5266213692 'I was quickly addicted to that "medium format" look.')

I don't really remember the sequence of events, but I think there was the borrowed <Camera name="Yashicamat 124G" />, then a <Camera name="Yashicamat 124" /> which I owned, and finally a <Camera name="Yashicamat EM" />. Both of the ones I owned had issues. The <Camera name="Yashicamat EM" /> had a broken lightmeter, and so I removed the whole front-plate given that it had no other purpose.

### Medium Format Upgrades

In 2011 I got really stuck into Medium format. This started with attempting to upgrade my TLR from a Yashica to a Rollei. I bought a <Camera name="Rolleiflex 3.5E" />. Unfortunately, no Rolleiflex I have owned has lasted very long, I have not found them to be reliable cameras.

![](flickr://5666474708 "I absolutely loved the images I got from using a Rolleiflex. My friend Lizzie on Rolleiflex 3.5E.")

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Rolleiflex 3.5E" />](/photos/tag?tag=Rolleiflex%203.5E)

If Rolleiflexes are not realiable, I've found Bronicas to be quite the opposite. I tried out a <Camera name="Bronica ETRSi" /> that I borrowed from University of Bristol Photosoc, and then bought a <Camera name="Bronica SQA" /> with 3 lenses. It was purchased before a trip to Iceland and I still have the whole set to this day.

![](flickr://6918724627 "I got the Bronica completely soaked to take photos Skógafoss. After giving it a little while to dry out it continued just fine.")

I also bought a <Camera name="Mamiya 645E" /> so that I could use a <Lens name="Mamiya Sekor 80mm f1.9" />. The lens is legendary, and I took a couple of pictures that hinted at how great it could be, but I just hated the camera. The size made it impossible to take anywhere, and it was unpleasant to use with the heaviest feeling shutter I've experienced. In hindsight I probably should have kept the lens, and tried a different body before selling the lot.

### Return to Digital

Planning my big trip to Iceland, I didn't want to take the risk of going 100% film. I wasn't sure what it would be like, and I was brand new to the Bronica at the time. Without it, I wouldn't have had any lightmetering capability on the trip.

The <Camera name="Panasonic Lumix GF-1" /> appealed based on its size, especially when coupled with the not-too-expensive <Lens name="Panasonic Lumix G 20mm f1.7" /> providing a fast, pancake sized, normal lens. Despite really enjoying this camera, I just wasn't really interested in digital at the time. It ended up being nothing more than an expensive lightmeter in Iceland and I sold it not much later. At some point I bought a strange eBay-wonder "CCTV" lens for it. It had absolutely no sharpness anywhere but the center of the frame, which was rather unique.

### Polaroid Land Camera

Having messed around with Pentax in previous years, I tried instant photography more seriously by aquiring a <Camera name="Polaroid Land Camera 340" /> from a friend. The photos, shot mostly on Fuji FP100c film (as the only one available at the time), are really wonderful to hold. I think this camera would have been a permanent keeper had the battery compartment not corroded everywhere.

![](flickr://27728639716 "When I think of this camera, I always think of this picture of Jon with a cactus. Polaroid Land Camera 340 / Fuji FP3000b film.")

### Fujifilm X100

I remember when the <Camera name="Fujifilm X100" /> was first announced, I instantly lusted after one. Compact body, amazing design, fast fixed lens, manual controls, digital. I left it a while though, considering them to expensive, but when my friend picked one up for a good price off eBay I couldn't resist following. I remember the feeling that the camera could basically shoot in darkness, it was a huge step forwards in low-light situations.

### Rangefinder awakening

Up to this point, my entire experience with rangefinders were older, cheaper, cameras with dim small rangefinder patches that made focusing very hard. A friend though had invested in Voigtlanders Leica M-mount equipment. I was able to borrow a <Camera name="Voigtlander Bessa R3M" /> and <Lens name="Zeiss 35mm Biogon f2" />. It was an entirely different experience. I would go on to turn almost my entire photography attention over to rangefinders, and would even buy my own <Lens name="Zeiss 35mm Biogon f2" /> within a couple of years. It's one of my most used lenses to this day.

- [Photos tagged with <Lens name="Zeiss 35mm Biogon f2" />](/photos/tag?tag=Zeiss%2035mm%20f2%20Biogon%20ZM)

After a lot of research, I decided to start my rangefinder collection with a <Camera name="Minolta CLE" /> and a <Lens name="Voigtlander Nokton 40mm f1.4 SC" />. I was attracted to the Minolta due to it being a small, M-mount rangefinder with aperture priority. I wasn't so keen on it only having 40mm framelines (as opposed to 35mm and 50mm), but the Nokton lens was available at a good price, and it was fast.

I definitely regret selling this kit. It's unsurpassed for me in 35mm.

### Medium format misfires

Another one-roll-wonder in the form of a 1930s <Camera name="Wirgin 6x9" /> folding camera. It was kind of fun, but had absolutely no sharpness about it whatsoever.

![](flickr://8429951283 "About as sharp as I got it with the Wirgin 6x9.")

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Wirgin 6x9" />](/photos/tag?tag=Wirgin%206x9%20folder)

I had another shot at buying a Rolleiflex. This time a <Camera name="Rolleiflex 2.8C" /> with a Xenotar lens. I really wanted the Planar lens, but so does everybody else, meaning it costs dramatically more money. As with the last Rolleiflex, it died after only a handful of rolls. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the 3.5E.

### Super-wide

My second lens for the Leica M system, and the first that I still have today. The <Lens name="Voigtlander Super-wide Heliar 15mm f4.5" /> has stuck with me for years, and has been on countless journeys, and on many many bodies at this point. It is very very wide. Stupidly so. It has some bad properties, but mostly, it just gets a lot of stuff in the frame.

<SubdivisionHeading>2014</SubdivisionHeading>

### Committing to M-mount

In 2014 I moved to Seattle, and found myself at a camera shop in my first weekend out there. I bought a <Camera name="Sony Alpha 7" /> with the intention of only ever using M-mount lenses on it. I paid for it with a cheque. The camera was full-frame and compact, it made total sense with M-mount lenses to me.

![](flickr://13807271774 "My first and only baseball game. Sony Alpha 7 / Voigtlander 40mm.")

With the 40mm and the 15mm I had decent normal and wide-angle options. I added an old <Lens name="Leica Elmar-C 90mm f4" />, which gave me a telephoto option. It was alright, a lot of the time I wanted to shoot things far away at infinity with this lens, and it just didn't do that particularly well. It was very cheap though.

### Another massive Mamiya

I bought a <Camera name="Mamiya Universal Press" /> with the idea that it would take amazing Polaroids. I never even put a normal roll of 120 through it. Yet again though, size was its downfall. This thing wouldn't even fit in my backpack. It was completely useless to me for shooting anywhere more than about 5 minutes walk from my home.

### Medium format rangefinder

My purchase of a <Camera name="Fujifilm GF670" /> on the other hand was a success, and it was a success precisely because its compact, and therefore, easy to use for any number of things. This one, alongside the Bronica is a keeper, I can't see why I'd ever get rid of it. It can shoot both 6x6 and 6x7 frames (though not interchangably within the same role). I thought I'd use this a lot, but in reality, I shoot mostly with 6x7. I can always crop to square, and the extra 2 shots per roll isn't worth it much of the time.

### Tiny Rangefinder

All the way back when I was buying the <Camera name="Olympus ECR" /> and <Camera name="Olympus Trip 35" /> what I really wanted was an <Camera name="Olympus XA" />. I snagged one off eBay on a whim, and put a couple of rolls through it. I liked almost none of the pictures though, so I moved it on.

![](flickr://19422559619 "Drive to Walla Walla. One I did like from the Olympus XA.")

### Zeiss

By this point I wanted to upgrade from the <Lens name="Voigtlander Nokton 40mm f1.4 SC" />. I wanted something a bit more technically good, something with a bit more edge-to-edge sharpness at wider apertures. I actually knew exactly what I wanted, because I'd had (borrowed) it before. I purchased a <Lens name="Zeiss 35mm Biogon f2" />. That led me to beleive that I should move on from the <Camera name="Minolta CLE" /> as well, as it doesn't have 35mm framelines. I bought a <Camera name="Zeiss Ikon" /> as a cheaper, though still massively expensive, alternative to a Leica. For some reason, I never really got on with it. I suspect maybe there was some rangefinder misalignment, mixed in with me not having a very good film scanner at the time.

### Digital Leica

At some point in 2016, I realized that an older digital Leica camera was within my grasp. I rented a <Camera name="Leica M-E" /> (the original 2012 version) to see how I liked it. I instantly loved it, the shooting experience was almost perfect. Noisier smaller files than the Sony Alpha 7, technology moves forwards after all, but I would choose the files from the Leica CCD sensor every time. Shortly after returning the rental, I bought a <Camera name="Leica M9" /> and assumed it would be a camera I would have for a very long time.

<SubdivisionHeading>2017</SubdivisionHeading>

In 2017, my <Camera name="Leica M9" /> developed the sensor corrosion issue that plagues that camera. I had to send it off to Leica, and the waiting times at that point were rediculous. The communication of how long you'd have to wait was non existent. I bought a <Camera name="Fujifilm X100T" /> to tide me over.

### Leica Upgrade

In 2018 I gave up waiting and headed to the Leica store. I dropped a big pile of money and bought a brand new <Camera name="Leica M10" />. The <Camera name="Leica M10" /> is the sensible choice for me. For some reason, I have never quite felt the passion for it that I felt for the M9 (probably that CCD magic again), but the M10 does absolutely everything I want, and is flawless to work with removing all of the little annoyances that were present with the M9.

### 50mm

I got really back into the idea of shooting 50mm again. My move to rangefinders had moved me to 40mm and then 35mm, with my 50mm days all the way back with my Pentax film SLRs.

First I bought a <Lens name="7artisans 50mm f1.1" /> which is a frankly silly lens. It can achieve a super-shallow depth of field, but it doesn't really tick any other boxes for me. It's big, it's heavy, and it doesn't take the pictures I wanted. It took me years to get around to selling it, but its gone now.

So in the end, I spent a bunch more money. A used but mint boxed <Lens name="Leica Summicron 50mm f2 (V)" /> appeared at my local Leica store. I traded in my M9 on the day it was returned to me to buy the lens. It quickly became my standard go-to lens, taking the majority of my pictures since. Another one I expect to keep forever.

<SubdivisionHeading>2019</SubdivisionHeading>

NOTHING! I didn't buy a single camera or lens. 2019 was a pretty difficult year to say the least, so I guess it wasn't top of my mind.

<SubdivisionHeading>2020</SubdivisionHeading>

### Lens Upgrades

2020: Lots of walking around Bristol taking photos of the same things over and over, but I did it with some upgraded equipment.

I bought some Leica lenses to replace the non-Leica lenses in my 3 lens setup. The <Lens name="Leica Super-Elmar-M 21mm f3.4" /> was an improvement in wide-angle. The <Lens name="Leica Elmarit-M 90mm f2.8" /> was an improvement in telephoto. In the case of the Elmarit-M I learned how to add Leica 6-bit encoding to the lens myself such that my M10 could correctly detect which lens was on the body.

### Monochrom

In May I bought a dream camera of mine. A <Camera name="Leica Monochrom (M9M)" />. This camera is exciting to use, and the detail contained in every file picture is absolutely mind blowing. The pictures consistently look great, even when you look at them at 100%. This has also really allowed me to see which lenses are better than others.

<SubdivisionHeading>2021</SubdivisionHeading>

### 35mm lenses

2021 I was able to buy another dream lens, the <Lens name="Leica Summicron 35mm f2 ASPH" />. This gives me a fully Leica 21/35/50/90 kit. However, I still haven't been able to bring myself to sell the <Lens name="Zeiss 35mm Biogon f2" />. I've had phases of preferring the photos taken with the Zeiss, though most likely I can't actually tell much between them. The Leica most definitely wins on size and handling, the Zeiss wins on price.

### Trying to shoot Polaroids

My <Camera name="Polaroid Land Camera 340" /> was busted, but there's still a handfull of packs of film in my fridge. First I tried getting a Polaroid back for my <Camera name="Bronica SQA" />, which wasn't super satisfying because of the small coverage area. Then I bought a <Camera name="Polaroid Land Camera 355" /> hoping for a direct replacement, unfortunately the cameras in poor condition, with some mechanical issues that means the lens isn't necessarily in line with the focus plane. Still I managed to take a couple of nice photos with some fancy "chocolate" Polaroid film I loaded into it.

<SubdivisionHeading>2022</SubdivisionHeading>

A friend introduced me to Ricoh compact cameras and their GR III inspired me to buy the <Camera name="Ricoh GR" />. I love the output it produces, and it's tiny size makes it the first legitimately pocketable camera that I've owned since the <Camera name="Olympus XA" />. I don't really like the looks and the controls, but there's nothing else as small with such a large sensor, so I accept what it is.

## 35mm lenses (again)

I continued to be unsure about my 35mm lenses, particularly frustrating given that I consider it my preferred focal length these days. I made a decision to sell both the <Lens name="Zeiss 35mm Biogon f2" /> and the <Lens name="Leica Summicron 35mm f2 ASPH" /> and splash the cash on a <Lens name="Leica Summilux 35mm f1.4 ASPH FLE" />. Then I changed my mind, chickening out based on the price and size of the Summilux.

In the meantime I tried out a friends <Lens name="Minolta M-Rokkor 40mm f2" />, and fell in love with it. Missing 40mm framelines from my rangefinders bothered me less than I thought it would, and the lens is so tiny that it can fill a niche for me as a good lens to carry when I want to travel light.

![](flickr://52613154260 "Wall, Banksy. Leica M Monochrom / Minolta M-Rokkor 40mm f2.")

[Photos tagged with <Lens name="Minolta M-Rokkor 40mm f2" />](/photos/tag?tag=Minolta%20M-Rokkor%2040mm%20f2)

I still felt the need for an actual 35mm that brought up correct framelines. I ended up buying the emminently sensible <Lens name="Voigtlander Ultron 35mm f2" />. I bought the earlier version with the kinda-odd styling. I don't mind it.

## 21mm trade

Having enjoyed the truly tiny size of the <Lens name="Voigtlander Ultron 35mm f2" /> and the <Lens name="Minolta M-Rokkor 40mm f2" /> I increasingly focused on getting the smallest lenses possible. While the <Lens name="Leica Super-Elmar-M 21mm f3.4" /> is a beautiful lens, Voigtlander offered a less perfect, but much smaller and cheaper option. I traded it for a <Lens name="Voigtlander Color-Skopar 21mm f3.5" />.

## Another Ricoh

Having sold the expensive <Lens name="Leica Summicron 35mm f2 ASPH" /> and <Lens name="Leica Super-Elmar-M 21mm f3.4" /> I impluse bought a <Camera name="Ricoh GR IIIx" />. There's something I haven't quite gotten to grips with yet about it, and instinctively I still prefer the output of the original GR.

![](flickr://52979018905 "Rooftops. Ricoh GR IIIx")

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Ricoh GR IIIx" />](/photos/tag?tag=Ricoh%20GR%20IIIx)

## 90mm trade

I jumped on another opportunity to trade a larger lens for a smaller lens. This time it was the <Lens name="Leica Elmarit-M 90mm f2.8" /> for the <Lens name="Leica Macro-Elmar-M 90mm f4" />. The size of this lens is really spectacular; a 90mm that (collapsed) is smaller than the <Lens name="Leica Summicron 50mm f2" />!
