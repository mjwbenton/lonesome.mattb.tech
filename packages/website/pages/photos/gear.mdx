# Gear

This post is to catalog the history of gear that I have owned. I initially became enthused with photography when I was mildly jealous of a digtal Canon compact camera that my sister had bought. It took AA batteries and drained them in a matter of minutes. My own first camera was a <Camera name="Fuji FinePix F30" />. My first "serious" camera, which at the time I would have thought of as completely synonymous with being a DSLR, was a <Camera name="Pentax K-m" />. Wanting cheaper lenses led me to older manual focus Pentax K mount lenses, and those in turn led me to the <Camera name="Pentax MX" /> 35mm film SLR. Everything else just follows from there.

### My First Camera

My first camera was a <Camera name="Fuji FinePix F30" />.

I'd done lots of online research reading reviews. I think I learned a lot of the basics of photography before I'd picked up the camera just be reading about it. ISO/Aperture/Shutter speed etc.

Looking back at it, it took nice pictures for what it was. Technology has come a long way though - these are clearly worse in many ways than an phone from 10 years later.

### The Pentax Era

I wanted to get a "proper camera". At the time this meant a DSLR. I was already into the idea of small though, something that would stick with me, bar a few mistakes here and there. The <Camera name="Pentax K-m" /> was one of the smallest DSLRs available at the time, and I remember being really bought into the idea of the in-body image stablization.

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Pentax K-m" />](/photos/tag?tag=Pentax%20K-m)

I had a couple of not-great kit lenses that came as part of the set.

- [Photos tagged with <Lens name="smc Pentax-DA 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 AL" />](/photos/tag?tag=smc%20Pentax-DA%2018-55mm%20f3.5-5.6%20AL)

I gained some understanding somewhere along the line that prime lenses would be sharper than zoom lenses. I'm not sure about today, but at the time, this was as true as anything. I didn't have much money to spend, but there were tons of quick prime lenses for Pentax K mount on eBay for < £30. I bought a <Lens name="smc Pentax-M 50mm f1.7" /> for somewhere around that figure, and I took 95%+ of my photos from then on using that lens. It didn't have auto-focus, which didn't bother me one bit (dispite me missing focus quite a lot given the limited help I got from the K-m body), and with the crop factor, it was the equivilant of a slightly awkward 75mm. But the pictures were sharper, and taking pictures was infinitely more fun.

![](flickr://4316875728 "Having a fast prime brought on a lot of gig photography. Pentax K-m / Pentax 50mm f1.7")

I bought some other lenses. They got used, but not exactly a lot in comparison to the nifty-fifty.

![](flickr://5213167608 "Photo with the Sigma 28mm from Westonbirt Arboretum.")

Just before the end of the year, I bought a film SLR for K mount, the <Camera name="Pentax MX" />. This is the camera that took my interest in photography another level. Playing around with film in 2009 had become a pretty niche interest. I shot my first roll of film visiting a friend studying a year abroad in Gratz alongside another friend.

### Pentax Continued

After hearing about my ventures into film, my Uncle passed his old film SLR onto me, which just so happened to be another Pentax, a <Camera name="Pentax K1000" /> with a <Lens name="smc Pentax-M 50mm f2" />. I barely touched the lens given I had the f1.7 version, and I'm pretty sure I ended up giving it to my sister at some point.

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Pentax K1000" />](/photos/tag?tag=Pentax%20K1000)

I didn't stop at 2 film SLRs. I added a <Camera name="Pentax ME Super" /> to the collection as it had aperture priority, which appealed to me over the fully manual process of shooting with the MX or K1000.

It's interesting how my interest in automation has changed over time. I feel quite firmly now that I want control over all of the things that are going to make the photo look like I want it to, and as little of anything else as possible. That means to me that aperture priority, with an exposure compensation dial trumps fully manual, as the vast majority time the shutter speed isn't really an important part of the end image as long as its exposed correctly.

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Pentax ME Super" />](/photos/tag?tag=Pentax%20ME%20Super)

I added a couple more lenses as well. First ultra-wide <Lens name="Cosina 20mm f3.8 MC" /> />, which I appear to have barely touched, and by most accounts is not a great lens. Second, and more interestingly, the <Lens name="smc Pentax-M 40mm f2.8" /> which is a tiny pancake lens.

### Canon Digital

While I continued on the Pentax front for film cameras, I'd fallen out with the <Camera name="Pentax K-m" />. In many respects it just wasn't very good, and I didn't have the right lenses given the crop factor! I remember bidding on this big batch load of Canon lenses alongside a <Camera name="Canon 40D" /> on ebay in the middle of a Computer Science lab at University. My student maintainace loan had come through, and I blew a huge chunk of it on this knowing I could sell most of the lenses and make a profit even when keeping the 40D.

According to the EXIF data on the photos, I'd bought the camera off a guy called "Robert Olejnik" — apparently I never did a factory reset.

I sold all the lenses that came with the body with the exception of a <Lens name="Canon EF 50mm f1.8 II" />. Shortly afterwards I added a <Lens name="Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC HSM" />. I have really fond memories of the Sigma; 30mm is finally a sensible normal focal length on a body with a crop factor.

### Continuing to explore film cameras

I have a full-on eBay habit at this point. Over the remainder of the year I bought a number of other film cameras that I proceeded to barely use. My one-roll-wonders so to speak.

The <Camera name="Olympus Trip 35" /> put me off zone-focusing. Mostly, it just didn't do anything that my other film cameras didn't already do better for me.

![](flickr://5086247353 "The Olympus Trip 35 was a pretty fun camera to take on a walk through the Mendips.")

The <Camera name="Olympus 35 ECR" /> put me off rangefinders. I struggled a bit with the focusing, not that I would miss the focus, but it took me too long with the small and unclear rangefinder path on my copy.

- [Photos tagged with <Camera name="Olympus 35 ECR" />](/photos/tag?tag=Olympus%2035%20ECR)

I also bought an <Camera name="Action Sampler" /> (or so it was called), which was a mildly distracting toy. It takes four photos on each frame, each one a short amount of time after the other. I never took a compelling photo that actually used the feature, instead I just got four poor quality pictures on each frame.

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Action Sampler" />](/photos/tag?tag=Action%20Sampler)

I also shot a single roll on a <Camera name="Kodak Pop" />. I think this camera maybe cost me a £2. There are only four photos tagged "Kodak Pop" on flickr, and all four of them are mine. They're not great.

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Kodak Pop" />](/photos/tag?tag=Kodak%20Pop)

I had a brief excursion into Canon film cameras with the <Camera name="Canon EOS 300" />. Wierdly, the only photos I have lying around from it were ones taken with the <Lens name="Sigma 30mm f1.4 EX DC HSM" />, which is only designed to cover the Canon digital crop sensors.

### Instax

I also started playing around with instant photography for the first time with the <Camera name="Fuji Instax Wide" />. My instax however developed a light leak after a while and then the motor that moved the lens jammed up. Gone before its time.

![](flickr://5283974244 "Light leak on my Fuji Instax Wide.")

### First Medium Format

My first dip into medium format was a borrowed <Camera name="Yashicamat 124G" />.

![](flickr://5266213692 'I was quickly addicted to that "medium format" look.')

I don't really remember the sequence of events, but I think there was the borrowed <Camera name="Yashicamat 124G" />, then a <Camera name="Yashicamat 124" /> which I owned, and finally a <Camera name="Yashicamat EM" />. Both of the ones I owned had issues. The <Camera name="Yashicamat EM" /> had a broken lightmeter, and so I removed the whole front-plate given that it had no other purpose.

### Medium Format Upgrades

In 2011 I got really stuck into Medium format. This started with attempting to upgrade my TLR from a Yashica to a Rollei. I bought a <Camera name="Rolleiflex 3.5E" />. Unfortunately, no Rolleiflex I have owned has lasted very long, I have not found them to be reliable cameras.

![](flickr://5666474708 "I absolutely loved the images I got from using a Rolleiflex. My friend Lizzie on Rolleiflex 3.5E.")

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Rolleiflex 3.5E" />](/photos/tag?tag=Rolleiflex%203.5E)

If Rolleiflexes are not realiable, I've found Bronicas to be quite the opposite. I tried out a <Camera name="Bronica ETRSi" /> that I borrowed from Photosoc for a whole, and then bought a <Camera name="Bronica SQA" /> with 3 lenses. It was purchased before a trip to Iceland and I still have the whole set to this day.

![](flickr://6918724627 "I got the Bronica completely soaked to take photos Skógafoss. After giving it a little while to dry out it continued just fine.")

I also bought a <Camera name="Mamiya 645E" /> so that I could use a <Lens name="Mamiya Sekor 80mm f1.9" />. The lens is legendary, and I took a couple of pictures that hinted at how great it could be, but I just hated the camera. The size made it impossible to take anywhere, and it was unpleasant to use with the heaviest feeling shutter I've experienced. In hindsight I probably should have kept the lens, and tried a different body before selling the lot.

### Return to Digital

Planning my big trip to Iceland, I didn't want to take the risk of going 100% film. I wasn't sure what it would be like, and I was brand new to the Bronica at the time. Without it, I wouldn't have had any lightmetering capability on the trip.

The <Camera name="Panasonic Lumix GF-1" /> appealed based on its size, especially when coupled with the not-too-expensive <Lens name="Panasonic Lumix G 20mm f1.7" /> providing a fast, pancake sized, normal lens. Despite really enjoying this camera, I just wasn't really interested in digital in this era. It ended up being an expensive pancake lens in Iceland and didn't last much longer than that. A bought a strange eBay-wonder "CCTV" lens for it as well at some point. It had absolutely no sharpness anywhere but the center of the frame, which was rather unique.

I've never really gotten on with 28mm, and so this lens was eclipsed by the 20mm (40mm equiv) for me. This photo however did represent the peak of my editing skills at the time with a couple of people cloned out of the shot to leave a lone figure.")

### Polaroid Land Camera

Having messed around with Pentax in previous years, I tried instant photography more seriously by aquiring a <Camera name="Polaroid Land Camera 340" /> from a friend. The photos, shot mostly on Fuji FP100c film (as the only one available at the time), are really wonderful to hold. I think this camera would have been a permanent keeper had the battery compartment not corroded everywhere.

![](flickr://27728639716 "When I think of this camera, I always think of this picture of Jon with a cactus. Polaroid Land Camera 340 / Fuji FP3000b film.")

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Polaroid Land Camera 340" />](/photos/tag?tag=Polaroid%20Land%20Camera%20340)

### Fujifilm X100

I remember when the <Camera name="Fujifilm X100" /> was first announced, I instantly lusted after one. Compact body, amazing design, fast fixed lens, manual controls, digital. I left it a while though, considering them to expensive, but when my friend picked one up for a good price off eBay I couldn't resist following. I remember the feeling that the camera could basically shoot in darkness, it was a huge step forwards for low-light situations.

### Rangefinder awakening

Up to this point, my entire experience with rangefinders were older, cheaper, cameras with dim small rangefinder patches that made focusing very hard. A friend though had invested into a Voigtlanders Leica M-mount equipment. I was able to borrow a <Camera name="Voigtlander Bessa R3M" /> and <Lens name="Zeiss 35mm Biogon f2" /> and it was an entirely different experience. I would go on to turn almost my entire photography attention over to rangefinders, and would even buy my own <Lens name="Zeiss 35mm Biogon f2" /> within a couple of years. It's one of my most used lenses to this day.

- [Photos tagged with <Lens name="Zeiss 35mm Biogon f2" />](/photos/tag?tag=Zeiss%2035mm%20Biogon%20f2)

After a lot of research, I decided to start my rangefinder collection with a <Camera name="Minolta CLE" /> and a <Lens name="Voigtlander Nokton 40mm f1.4 SC" />. I was attracted to the Minolta due to it being a small, M-mount rangefinder with aperture priority. I wasn't so keen on it only having 40mm framelines (as opposed to 35mm and 50mm), but the Nokton lens was available at a good price, and it was fast.

![](flickr://7669563092 "My late grandfather. Minolta CLE / Voigtlander 40mm f1.4.")

I definitely regret selling this kit, as it was excellent really. I sold it because I wanted to standardize away from 40mm and towards 35mm, which wasn't possible with this camera.

### Medium format misfires

Another one-roll-wonder in the form of a 1930s <Camera name="Wirgin 6x9" /> folding camera. It was kind of fun, but had absolutely no sharpness about it whatsoever.

![](flickr://8429951283 "About as sharp as I got it with the Wirgin 6x9.")

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Wirgin 6x9" />](/photos/tag?tag=Wirgin%206x9%20folder)

I had another shot at buying a Rolleiflex. This time a <Camera name="Rolleiflex 2.8C" /> with a Xenotar lens. I really wanted the Planar lens, but so does everybody else, meaning it costs dramatically more money. As with the last Rolleiflex, it died after only a handful of rolls. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the 3.5E.

![](flickr://14803413758 "The Rollei had a partially successful trip to Chicago before the shutter stopped consistently firing")

### Super-wide

My second lens for the Leica M system, and the first that I still have today. The <Lens name="Voigtlander Super-wide Heliar 15mm f4.5" /> has stuck with me for years, and has been on countless journeys, and on many many bodies at this point. It is very very wide. Stupidly so. It has some bad properties, but mostly, it just gets a lot of stuff in the frame.

<SubdivisionHeading>2014</SubdivisionHeading>

### Committing to M-mount

In 2014 I moved to Seattle, and found myself at a camera shop in my first weekend out there. I bought a <Camera name="Sony Alpha 7" /> with the intention of only ever using M-mount lenses on it. The camera was full-frame and compact, it made total sense with M-mount lenses to me.

![](flickr://13807271774 "My first and only baseball game. Sony Alpha 7 / Voigtlander 40mm.")

With the 40mm and the 15mm I had decent normal and wide-angle options. I added an old <Lens name="Leica Elmar-C 90mm f4" />, which gave me a telephoto option. It was alright, a lot of the time I wanted to shoot things far away at infinity with this lens, and it just didn't do that particularly well. It was very cheap though.

### Another massive Mamiya

I bought a <Camera name="Mamiya Universal Press" /> with the idea that it would take amazing Polaroids. I never even put a normal roll of 120 through it. Yet again though, size was its downfall. This thing wouldn't even fit in my backpack. It was completely useless to me for shooting anywhere more than about 5 minutes walk from my home.

### Medium format rangefinder

My purchase of a <Camera name="Fujifilm GF670" /> on the other hand was a success, and it was a success precisely because its compact, and therefore, easy to use for any number of things. This one, alongside the Bronica is a keeper, I can't see why I'd ever get rid of it. It can shoot both 6x6 and 6x7 frames (though not interchangably). I thought I'd use this a lot, but in reality, I shoot mostly with 6x7. I can always crop to square, and the extra 2 shots per roll isn't worth it much of the time.
