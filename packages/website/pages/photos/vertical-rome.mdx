# Vertical Rome

Went back to Rome almost 8 years after my [previous visit](/photos/rome.html).

Looking at my photos from this trip it struck me that many of my favorite pictures were vertical — Rome's architecture and narrow streets lend themselves very well to the camera being held that way round.

Pictures here taken with a mixture of my _Leica M10_ and _Zeiss Ikon_ rangefinders. Most pictures were taken with my _Leica Summicron 50mm f2_, plus a couple from my _Voigtländer Super Wide Heliar 15mm f4.5_. Mixture of _Fuji Neopan 100_ and _Kodak TMAX 400_ films.
