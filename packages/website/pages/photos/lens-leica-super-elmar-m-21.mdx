# Lens – Leica Super-Elmar-M 21mm f3.4

My favorite photos taken with my Leica Super-Elmar-M 21mm f3.4. I purchased this lens in 2020, to build a fully Leica 21/50/90 lineup. In 2023 I've decided to sell it and replace it with a Voigtlander 21mm f3.5 Color-Skopar. Sure it's not quite as good, but the tiny size, and the more reasonable cost, makes a lot more sense for a lens that's always just a secondary option in my bag.
