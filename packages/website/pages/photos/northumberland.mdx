# Northumberland

Shots from a trip to Northumberland. On the first day we walked from Alnmouth to Craster. On the second day we visited Alnwick and Alnwick Gardens. On the third day we walked from Beadnell to Bamburgh.

All colour photos were shot with my _Fujifilm GF670_ on _Kodak Ektar 100_. All black and white photos were taken with my _Ricoh GR_.
