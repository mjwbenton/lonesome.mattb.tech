# Niu Mini

![](flickr://50181498277)

Got the itch to make a new board, and I've been interested in trying a 40% for a while. Wasn't quite so keen on an orthlinear, but when I noticed that the Niu Mini was available again I thought I'd give that a try too.

The outcome: So quick to build, so slow to write about.

My fingers do not know how to use this board. Every <kbd>Tab</kbd> comes out as a <kbd>Esc</kbd>.

> This is a sentencve that I wrote withoit using bacvkspave,

Coding is even worse; where is the <kbd>\{</kbd> key again?

## Build

Nothing very exciting about the build. Super quick to put together, and as my third build I did a much cleaner job.

## Layout

One of the things that was a must for me with this build was being supported by QMK.

[Link to commit containing my layout](https://github.com/mjwbenton/qmk_firmware/commit/573bbbcd9f1611dbdb22fec578dc377c00a6057)

My layout is inspired by being a mixture of quite standard for a 40%, and being easy for me to come over to from the layout I created for 60% on my [first board](/keyboard/first-build.html).
