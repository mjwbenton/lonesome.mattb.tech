# Recently Watching

What I've been watching recently. Powered by [billio](https://github.com/mjwbenton/billio). Currently doesn't support series, so they don't appear here.

Data was imported from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com) ratings where noted. Some older entries are when I rated them, but not necessarily when I saw them for the first time.
