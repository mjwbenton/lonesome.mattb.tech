# Welcome

I like building things. I like keeping track of what I'm doing. I like the idea of sharing the stuff I'm interested in, but social media makes me uneasy.

This website hits all of these targets. I get to build something that helps me keep track of what I'm up to.
I get to share it with whoever I want without having to touch a social media website. For the most part I just get to look at it myself, hence "lonesome" media.
